# NerdFont-Cheat-Sheet

`nerdfont.csv` is a generated CSV that includes all of the Nerd Font icons and their description, as found on [Nerd Font's Cheat Sheet website](https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet).

`nerdfont.txt` is a more readable version of that file


## Usage

Put `nerdfontmenu` in your `$PATH` or a symlink to it. Ensure that `nerdfont.txt` is in the same location as the actual `nerdfontmenu` file. To open the menu run

```
nerdfontmenu
```

The selection will be added to the clipboard.
